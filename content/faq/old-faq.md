## Pricing

- Is a free trial available before I purchase?

    Yes, we offer a 14 days free trial. To activate your free trial, sign up on the app [app.localstack.cloud](https://app.localstack.cloud). Under the billing section click on create a new plan.

## Application

- Where can I find my invoices?

    You can find your entire invoice history in your account details at [Account billing section](https://app.localstack.cloud/account#billing).

    Please note, if you are part of an organization account, only your organization’s admins have access to the billing section.

- I would like to cancel my trial. How do I do that?

    Your free trial will automatically expire after 14 days - no need to manually cancel it. We do not automatically add a paid license at the end of the free trial.

- Where can I add more licenses?

    You can create new subscriptions on [Account billing section](https://app.localstack.cloud/account#billing) by using the **+ ADD NEW PLAN** button.

    Please note, if you are part of an organization account, only your organization’s admins have access to the billing section and can assign API keys to you in the member section at [Account members section](https://app.localstack.cloud/account#members).

## Product

- Can I use LocalStack PRO features on a computer not connected to the internet?

    LocalStack Pro currently requires internet connectivity for a short period of time at start up, to activate the API key. Once the stack is up and running and initialized, you should be able to use it offline as well. We also have a mechanism that caches the activation key for a certain period of time (e.g., ~6hours) on the local machine.

- Can API keys be shared by more than 1 developer at a time?

    LocalStack Pro Individual user licenses are bound to one individual developer. As per our terms of use individual user licenses are not offered as a license pool and are not available to be used in CI Systems. You can reassign licenses on a monthly basis, but not change users more frequently.

- I upgraded to the LocalStack Pro Edition (Individual Developer). Can I get all the resources from the free trial transferred to the new subscription?

    You get a new API key when switching from the free 14 day trial to the pro subscription. So any usage events generated towards the old trial key won't be visible.
