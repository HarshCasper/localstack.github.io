Unlike deploying your code on a server, you can now break down your application into many independent functions and deploy them as a singular units. With the help of AWS Lambda, you can strive for more modular code that can be tested and debugged while integrated with the AWS infrastructure and your core system.</description></item><item><title>Introducing LocalStack Cockpit</title><link>https://localstack.cloud/blog/2022-02-07-localstack-cockpit/</link><pubDate>Fri, 18 Mar 2022 13:10:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://localstack.cloud/blog/2022-02-07-localstack-cockpit/</guid><description>The new LocalStack Cockpit is now available.

Developers are faced with a slow and tedious code â†’ deploy â†’ test â†’ redeploy â†’ &amp;hellip; cycle and often find themselves packaging and uploading their serverless applications tens or hundreds of times a day. These inherent limitations and hurdles in developing cloud applications have caused some folks to compare the cloud to the new mainframe era.</description></item></channel></rss>
