LocalStack is a platform that simplifies and accelerates development of cloud applications. At its core, LocalStack provides a cloud service emulation layer that runs in a single container on your laptop or in your CI environment. With LocalStack, you can run your AWS services or Lambdas entirely on your local machine without connecting to a remote cloud provider.
LocalStack focuses on developer experience (DevX) and offers a number of team collaboration features on top of the core emulation layer, like advanced persistence mechanisms that allow reuse and sharing of resources among team members and across environments.</description></item><item><title>Free Educational License</title><link>/educational-license/</link><pubDate>Sat, 01 Jan 2022 06:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/educational-license/</guid><description>LocalStack Education License helps you learn and gain AWS skills and expertise through LocalStack&amp;rsquo;s fully functional local AWS cloud stack.
