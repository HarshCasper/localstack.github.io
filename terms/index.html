No party will be responsible for any delay or failure to perform under the Agreement due to force majeure events (e.g. natural disasters; terrorist activities, activities of third party service providers, labor disputes; and acts of government) and acts beyond a party’s reasonable control, but only for so long as those conditions persist.</p><h3 id=contracting-party-choice-of-law-and-location-for-resolving-disputes>Contracting Party, Choice of Law and Location for Resolving Disputes</h3><p>The failure of LocalStack to exercise or enforce any right or provision of the Terms of Service shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.
